\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

\textbf{eulerr} relies on an extensive machinery to turn user input into
a pretty Euler diagram. Little, or in fact none, of this requires any
tinkering from the user. To make that happen, however, \textbf{eulerr}
needs to make several well-formed decisions about the design of the
diagram on behalf of the user, which is not a trivial task.

This document outlines the implementation of \textbf{eulerr} from input
to output. It is designed to an up-to-date paper on the innards of the
program and is therefore likely to evolve as time goes on.

\section{Input}\label{input}

The main function of \textbf{eulerr} is \texttt{euler()}. To start with,
we need input in the form of

\begin{itemize}
\item
  a named numeric vector, such as
  \texttt{c(A\ =\ 10,\ B\ =\ 5,\ "A\&B"\ =\ 3)}, where ampersands define
  disjoint set combinations or unions, depending on the argument
  \texttt{input},
\item
a \texttt{data.frame} or \texttt{matrix} of logicals or binary indices
where each row denotes the set relationships of
\begin{itemize}
\item
either a single observation
<<>>=
matrix(sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), 12, replace = TRUE),
       ncol = 3,
       dimnames = list(NULL, c("A", "B", "C")))
@
\item
or of a unique set combination if a numeric vector is supplied to the
argument \texttt{weights},
<<>>=
matrix(c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE,
         TRUE, TRUE, FALSE,
         FALSE, FALSE, TRUE),
       ncol = 3,
       dimnames = list(NULL, c("A", "B", "C")))
@
\end{itemize}
\item
a \texttt{table} (max 3 dimensions),
<<>>=
as.table(apply(Titanic, 2:4, sum))
@
\item
or a list of sample spaces, such as
<<>>=
list(A = c("x", "xy", "xyz"),
     B = c("xy"),
     C = c("x", "xyz"))
@
\end{itemize}

\noindent If the \texttt{data.frame} or \texttt{matrix} form is used, the user
additionally has the option to split the data set by a factor and
compute separate euler diagrams for each split. This is accomplished by
supplying a factor variable to the \texttt{by} arguments (see the
documentation in \texttt{?base::by}).

\section{Pre-processing}\label{pre-processing}

\textbf{eulerr} organizes the input of the user into a matrix of binary
indexes, which in \textbf{R} is represented as a matrix of logicals. For
a three set configuration, this looks like this,

<<>>=
library(eulerr)
eulerr:::bit_indexr(3)
@

and is accompanied by a vector of the \emph{disjoint} areas of the set
combinations.

To provide a starting configuration, we work exclusively with circles
and, given these areas, we figure out the required pairwise distance
between the sets to achieve a circle--circle overlap that matches the
set intersection between the sets. We do this numerically, using the
formula for a circle--circle overlap,
\begin{multline}
A = r_1^2\arccos\left(\frac{d^2 + r_1^2 - r_2^2}{2dr_1}\right) +
r_2^2\arccos\left(\frac{d^2 + r_2^2 - r_1^2}{2dr_2}\right) - \\
\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{(-d + r_1 + r_2)(d + r_1 - r_2)(d - r_1 + r_2)(d + r_1 + r_2)},
\end{multline}
where \emph{r\textsubscript{1}} and \emph{r\textsubscript{2}} are the
radii of the first and second circles respectively and \emph{d} the
distance between the circles.

\emph{r\textsubscript{1}} and \emph{r\textsubscript{2}} are known but
because \emph{d} is not, we approximate it using one-dimensional
numerical optimization. Our loss function is the squared difference
between \emph{A} and the desired overlap, which we then optimize using
\textbf{R}'s \texttt{optimize()}, which is a ``combination of golden
section search and successive parabolic interpolation''.

<<>>=
r1 <- 0.7 #radius of set 1
r2 <- 0.9 #radius of set 2
overlap <- 1 #area of overlap

stats::optimize(eulerr:::discdisc, #computes the squared loss
                interval = c(abs(r1 - r2), sum(r1, r2)),
                r1 = r1,
                r2 = r2,
                overlap = overlap)

# minimum is our required distance
@

\noindent Now that we have the distances, we can proceed to the next step:
computing an initial configuration.

\section{Initial configuration}\label{initial-configuration}

Our initial layout can be setup in a number of ways; \textbf{eulerr}
uses one of the methods from Fredrickson's
\href{https://github.com/benfred/venn.js/}{venn.js}, which features a
constrained version of multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) based on that of
Wilkinson's \textbf{R} package
\href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=venneuler}{venneuler}
(Wilkinson 2012). \textbf{venneuler} tries to place disjoint and subset
exactly neck-in-neck and at the exact midpoint of the set respectively.
However, since we are indifferent about where in the space outside (or
respectively inside) the sets are placed, that behavior becomes
problematic since it might interfere with locations of other sets that
need to occupy some of that space.

The MDS algorithm from \textbf{venn.js} circumvents this by assigning a
loss and gradient of 0 when, for instance, the set relationsships
\emph{and} the candidate ellipses are disjoint. Then, to optimize the
pairwise relationsships between sets, \textbf{eulerr} uses the following
loss and gradient functions.

\begin{quote}
\[\small
\text{loss} = \sum_i \sum_j { {\begin{cases}
    0 & \text{disjoint}(i, j)\\
    0 & \text{subset}(i, j)\\
    ((X_{i} - X_{j})^T(X_{i} - X_{j}) - D_{ij}^2) ^2  & \text{otherwise} \\
\end{cases}}}
\]

\[\small
\nabla f(X_{i}) = \sum_j {\begin{cases}
     \vec{0} & \text{disjoint}(i, j)\\
     \vec{0} & \text{subset}(i, j)\\
     4 {((X_{i} - X_{j})^T(X_{i} - X_{j}) - D_{ij}^2)} (X_{i} -
     X_{j}) & \text{otherwise} \\
\end{cases}}\] \emph{Source:
\href{http://www.benfrederickson.com/better-venn-diagrams/}{Better Venn
Diagrams} by Ben Fredrickson, which includes a nice interactive
demonstration.}
\end{quote}

Fredrickson uses the \emph{Polak--RibiÃ©re Conjugate Gradient Method} to
optimize the initial layout. In our experience this method occasionally
ends up in local minima, which is why we have opted to use
\texttt{nlm()} from the \textbf{R} core package \texttt{stats}, which is
a translation from FORTRAN code developed by Schnabel, Koonatz, and
Weiss (1985) and uses a mixture of algorithms (Newton and Quasi-Newton).

This initial configuration will work perfectly for any 1--2 set
combinations and as well as possible with 3 sets if we use circles but
for all other combinations there is usually a need to fine tune the
configuration.

\section{Final configuration}\label{final-configuration}

In order to finalize the configuration we need to be able to compute the
areas of the overlaps of the sets, which as it turns out, is \emph{not}
trivial. In fact, most of methods rely on approximations of the areas
by, for instance, quad-tree binning (\textbf{venneuler}) or polygon
intersections (\textbf{VennMaster} (Kestler et al. 2008)). These methods
yield reasonable estimates but, given that the computation may have to
run for a vast number of iterations, are usually prohibitive in terms of
performance.

\textbf{venn.js} and \textbf{eulerAPE} both, however, use exact
algorithms. Based on the fact that any intersection of ellipses can be
represented as a convex polygon with elliptical segments on the fringes,
it is possible to arrive at exact area calculations.

\subsection{Intersections}\label{intersections}

Finding the areas of the overlaps exactly requires that we first know
the points at which the different ellipses intersect. \textbf{eulerr}'s
approach to this is based on a method outlined by Richter-Gebert (2011).
\textbf{eulerr} owes significant debt to the \textbf{R} package
\textbf{RConics} (Huber 2014), which has been tremendously helpful in
developing and, especially, debugging the algorithm. Some parts of the
code are in fact straight-up translations to C++ from the code in
\textbf{RConics}.

The method is based in \emph{projective geometry} (rather than
euclidean). To find the intersection points, the algorithm first

\begin{itemize}
\item
  converts the two ellipses from canonical form to matrix notation. The
  canonical form of a rotated ellipse is given by \[
  \frac{((x-h)\cos(\phi)+(y-k)\sin(\phi))^2}{a^2}+\frac{((x-h) \sin(A)-(y-k)
    \cos(\phi))^2}{b^2} = 1,
  \] where \emph{phi} is the counter-clockwise angle from the positive x
  axis to the semi-major axis \emph{a}. \emph{b} is the semi-minor axis
  whilst \emph{(h, k)} is the center of the ellipse. This is then
  converted to the matrix form \[
  E = \begin{bmatrix}A & B/2 & D/2 \\
                 B/2 & C & E/2 \\
                 D/2 & E/2 & F
  \end{bmatrix},
  \] which may be used to represent any conic. We then
\item
  split one of the ellipses (conics) into a pencil of two lines, and
  subsequently
\item
  intersect the remaining conic with these two lines, which will yield
  between 0 and 4 intersection points.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Areas}\label{areas}

The next step is to calculate the area of overlap between all the
possible combinations of ellipses. The solution to this was discovered,
as far as I know, by Fredrickson who explains it beautifully in a
\href{http://www.benfrederickson.com/calculating-the-intersection-of-3-or-more-circles/}{blog
post}. It relies on finding all the intersection points between the
currently examined sets that are also within these sets. It is then
trivial to find the area of the convex polygon that these vertices make
up. Finding the rest of the area, which is made up of the ellipse
segments between subsequent points, requires a bit of trigonometry.

Here, we have used an algorithm from Eberly (2016), which computes
circle integral between the points on the ellipse minus the area of the
triangle made up of the center of the ellipse: \[
A(\theta_0, \theta_1) = F(\theta_1) - F(\theta_1) -
\frac{1}{2}|x_1y_0 - x_0y_1|,
\] \[
\text{where } F(\theta) = \frac{a}{b}\left[ \theta -
\arctan{\left(\frac{(b - a)\sin{2\theta}}{b + a +(b - a )\cos{2\theta}} \right)}
\right]
\]

As our loss function, we use the sum of squared differences between the
disjoint set intersections and the areas we have computed and again use
the \texttt{nlm()} optimizer to layout the set.

This optimization step is the bottleneck of the overall computations in
terms of performance, being that we're optimizing over 5 parameters for
every ellipse (or 3 in the case of circles) -- nevertheless, we're
profitting immensely from the implementation in the C++ programming
language through \textbf{Rcpp} (Eddelbuettel and FranÃ§ois 2011) and its
plugin for the linear algebra library \textbf{Armadillo} (Eddelbuettel
and Sanderson 2014) which ends up making the code much faster than the
java-based \textbf{venneuler}.

\section{Layout}\label{layout}

Since the optimization steps are unconstrained, we run the risk of
ending up with dispersed layouts. To fix this, we use the SKYLINE-BL
rectangle packing algorithm (JylÃ¤nki 2010) to pack the disjoint clusters
of ellipses (in case there are any) into a heuristically chosen bin.

At the time of writing this algorithm is crudely implemented -- for
instance, it does not attempt to rotate the rectangles (boundaries for
the ellipses) or attempt to use. Since we're dealing with a rather
simple version of the rectangle packing problem, however, it seems to do
the trick.

\section{Output}\label{output}

Before we get to plotting the solution, it is useful to know how well
the fit from \textbf{eulerr} matches the input. Sometimes euler diagrams
are just not feasible, particular for combinations with many sets, in
which case we should stop here and look for another design to visualize
the set relationships.

It is not, however, obvious what it means for a euler diagram to ``fit
well''. \textbf{venneuler} uses a metric called \emph{stress}, which is
defined as \[
\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i) ^ 2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i ^ 2}
\] where \(\hat{y}_i\) is an ordinary least squares estimate from the
regression of the fitted areas on the original areas that is being
explored during optimization.

Meanwhile, \textbf{eulerAPE} (Micallef and Rodgers 2014--17AD) uses
\emph{diagError}: \[
\max_{i = 1, 2, \dots, n} \left| \frac{y_i}{\sum y_i} -
  \frac{\hat{y}_i}{\sum \hat{y}_i} \right|
\]

Both metrics are given the user after the diagram has been fit, together
with a table of residuals.
