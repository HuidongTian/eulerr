\arguments{
\item{combinations}{Set relationships as a named numeric vector, matrix, or
data.frame. (See the methods (by class) section for details.)}

\item{by}{A factor or character vector used in \code{\link[base]{by}} to
split the data.frame or matrix and compute euler diagrams for each split.}

\item{cost}{Cost function to use in optimizing the fit. See details.}

\item{\dots}{Currently ignored.}
}
\value{
A list object of class 'euler' with the following parameters.
  \item{coefficients}{A matrix of x and y coordinates for the centers of the
    circles and their radiuses.}
  \item{original.values}{Set relationships provided by the user.}
  \item{fitted.values}{Set relationships in the solution.}
  \item{residuals}{Residuals.}
  \item{diagError}{The largest absolute residual in percentage points
    between the original and fitted areas.}
  \item{stress}{The stress of the solution, computed as the sum of squared
    residuals over the total sum of squares.}
}
\description{
Compute Euler diagrams (a generalization of Venn diagrams) using
numerical optimization to find exact or approximate solutions to a
specification of set relationships.
}
\details{
If \code{by} is specified, \code{euler} returns a list of euler diagrams
that can be plotted in facets via a special plot method.

The fit is optimized using either the cost function used in the
eulerAPE software package or the stress statistic of the R package
\pkg{venneuler}. The eulerAPE cost function is defined as

\deqn{%
  \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{(y_i - \hat{y}_i) ^ 2}{\hat{y}_i}
}{%
  (1 / n) \sum (orig - fit) / \sum fit
}

where \eqn{\hat{y}}{fit} are the estimates of \eqn{y} that are currently
explored during optimization. For \code{venneuler}, the stress function is
defined as

\deqn{%
  \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i) ^ 2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i ^ 2}
}{%
  (\sum (fit - orig) ^ 2) / (\sum orig ^ 2)
}

where \eqn{\hat{y}}{fit} are OLS estimates from the regression of the fitted
areas on the original areas that are currently being explored during
optimization.

\section{Methods (by class)}{
\itemize{
\item \code{default}: A named numeric vector, with
interactions seperated by an ampersand, for instance \code{`A&B` = 10}.
Missing interactions are treated as being 0.

\item \code{matrix}: A matrix of logical vectors with columns representing sets
and rows representing each observation's set relationships (see examples).

\item \code{data.frame}: A data.frame that can be converted to a matrix of logicals
(as in the description above) via \code{\link[base]{as.matrix}}.

\examples{
fit1 <- euler(c("A" = 1, "B" = 0.4, "C" = 3, "A&B" = 0.2))

# Same result as above
fit2 <- euler(c("A" = 1, "B" = 0.4, "C" = 3,
                 "A&B" = 0.2, "A&C" = 0, "B&C" = 0,
                 "A&B&C" = 0) )

# Using the matrix method
fit3 <- euler(mat)

# Using grouping via the 'by' argument

fit4 <- euler(dat[, 1:2], by = dat[, 3:4])

# A set with no perfect solution
rel <- c("a" = 3491, "b" = 3409, "c" = 3503,
         "a&b" = 120, "a&c" = 114, "b&c" = 132, "a&b&c" = 50)
